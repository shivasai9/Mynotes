closures are nothing but the functions which remembers its scope.

example:

var a = 10;

function outer(){
  var b = 20;

  var inner = function (){
   console.log(a);
   console.log(b);
  }
  return inner;
}

var innerFn = outer(); =====> here innerFn is a closure which remembers the scope of its variables during its declaration.

innerFn();

setTimeOut also uses closures internally.
