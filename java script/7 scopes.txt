in js by using a block we cannot create a scope.

we will create a scope in js by using a function.

java script uses lexical scoping.
what is lexical scoping???
  any varibles which are declared inside the function cannot be accessed outside of that function and any variables 
  which are declared outside the function can be accessed inside of that function this is called lexical scoping.

example:-

var a=10;

function x(){
            var a = 20;
            console.log(a);========> output is 20, first it looks for innerscope and then it searches for outer scope.
             }


iife

/*
   what is iife???
     it stands for immediately invoked function expression.
     global variables are bad.
     for example if we want to load a page then that page is linked to 10 different java script files in
     which the code may be written by different persons.
     all those scripts are executed in a common space in a page.
     if there is a global variable in one file then that global variable can be accessed in all the 10 files.
     this is the disadvantage of global variable to avoid this we need to use iife.
     
     example-1:
     var a=10;
     var b=10;
     console.log(a+b);
     in the above example-1 a and b are global.
     a and b are accessed in all the files which are linked to the page then the a and b maybe overrride.
     due to this overriding result may change /alter.
     to avoid this we should include variables a nd b in a function.
     example-2:
     function add(){
        var a=10;
        var b=10;
        console,log(a+b);
     }
    add();//function call
    in the above example-2 the variables a and b are not global but there is one problem in this code.
    i.e here add()  is a global function. if somebody from another file may call the add() which is
    undesirable.
    to avoid the above problem we use iife.

//iife example

(function(){
    var a=10;
    var b=10;
    console.log(a+b);
})();

/* in the above iife example the variables a and b are not global and functon is a ananomous function.
so we cannot call the function from another other files.
iife is also a function which calls automatically when the program starts execution.
