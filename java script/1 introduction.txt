server will send a html page to the browser then the browser converts each html tag into a object like wise it 
constructs a tree of objects called dom tree which is responsible for the view

but the view is static if we want to make the view dynamic then use java script.



java script converts static html pages into dynamic

java script is used at run time environment like at browsers

java script doesn't have a compilation phase

java script is used to modify the dom tree at run time

browsers will run  the java script.
