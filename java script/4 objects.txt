an object in js is different from java.

object in js will not bound to a class. 

an object in java script is nothing but a collection of name(property) value pairs

  name value pair is a object

ex:
    address(name) = 'xyz'(value) // name value pair

value may be another name value pair or another object

ex:
   address = { 
              name = "shiva sai",
              street = { 
                        no = 2434,
                        name = 'xyz'
                        }

               }


by using dot(.) operator we can add a new member(name value pair) to the object and we can use it to retrive(access) the member of the object. 

we get undefined if we access the property which was not there in the object.

objects can have methods.
