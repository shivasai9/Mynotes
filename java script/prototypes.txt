  when ever we create a function java script engine creates two objects 
  1. the object with the name of the function
  2.the prototype object

java script engine creates a prototype property in function object to access the prototype object.
from the function object we can access the prototype object by using the prototype property in function object(refer prototype.jpg)

when ever we call a function using new keyword then it returns an other object which points to prototype object. we can access prototype object by using __proto__ property.
