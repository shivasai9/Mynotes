it doesn't matter where we declare the variables either after the usage or before while
compilation all the variables are lifted or hoisted to top level and then interpretation
runs

hoisting will not work for function expressions.

example:

fnA();

var fnA = function (){
}

strict mode in java script

it is used to restrict the behaviour of the java script.
