
<
component.variable = value;
fixture.detectChanges();

we need to explicitily call the angular for change detection
we will write this whenever we change the value which will be used in dom otherewise the changed value will not be updated in dom.

<
 let button=fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('.glyphicon'));
 button.triggerEventHandler('click',null);

     .triggerEventHandler('event',data);===> 1st argument is the event which we want to occur

                                             2nd argument is the additional data which we can send about event

 in integration testing if we want to create a instance for a component then we use the following code 

    beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(Test2Component);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  }); 

  if the component has a dependencies like services then we need to add that dependencies in the dynamic module of that testing environment as follows

  beforeEach(async(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports:[],
      declarations: [Test2Component],
      providers:[TestService]
    })
      .compileComponents();
  }));

 in unit test we add it in while creating the object as follows
  
  component = new Testcomponent(Service);
